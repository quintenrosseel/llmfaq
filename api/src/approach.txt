Take each answer, calculate the embedding of each archetype_question associated to it

For each question, calculate the distance between the archetype question and the question.

Pick the closest archetype question

Check that the closest archetype question is the associated to the question



For question in questions:
    distances = []
    For answer in answers:
	    distance = calculate_distance(answer.archetype_question, question)
        distances.push({ "distance": distance, answer })
    closest_answer = min_distance(distances)
    If question.associated_answer == closest_answer:
	print("great!")
    Else:
	print("bad")
